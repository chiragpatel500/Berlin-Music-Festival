          Spring means festival season is around the corner and with it comes
          music, dancing, and a flurry of social media posting. Many major music
          festival posters become collectible artifacts for the memories they
          evoke–and as branding assets, there’s much to learn from the best
          festival poster designs for their ability to balance a lot of
          information and capture a vibe. Ultimately, a festival poster is a
          flyer, conveying the who, what, where, and when, while the artful use
          of imagery and type turn these advertisements into hangable art. Check
          out some of the best festival poster designs out there and why they
          work, then hop into Spark’s online poster maker to apply these
          learnings to your next design–we’ve got customizable festival-inspired
          poster templates to help you get started.
